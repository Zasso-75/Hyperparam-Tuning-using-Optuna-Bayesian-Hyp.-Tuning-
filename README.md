# Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna, Grid Search, and Random Search

This project demonstrates efficient hyperparameter tuning of a **Random Forest Classifier** using three different methods:

* ✅ **Bayesian Optimization with Optuna**
* ↻ **Grid Search (exhaustive)**
* 🎲 **Random Search (random sampling)**

## 🚀 Optuna with Bayesian Optimization

### 🧠 What is Bayesian Optimization?

Bayesian optimization is a smart technique for optimizing expensive functions (like model training). It uses a **surrogate model** to approximate the objective function and an **acquisition function** to decide the next best set of parameters to evaluate.

* **Surrogate Function**: A probability model (like Tree-structured Parzen Estimator — TPE in Optuna) that approximates the unknown objective function.
* **Acquisition Function**: Selects the most promising hyperparameter values based on the surrogate model by balancing exploration and exploitation.

### ⚙️ Objective Function

We defined an `objective(trial)` function for Optuna where it:

* Suggests values for hyperparameters
* Trains a `RandomForestClassifier`
* Returns the validation accuracy (which Optuna tries to maximize)

```python
params = {
    'n_estimators' : trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 100, 1000, step=100),
    'max_depth' : trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 3, 15),  # selects int in [3, 15]
    'min_samples_split': trial.suggest_int('min_samples_split', 2, 20),
    'max_features' : trial.suggest_categorical('max_features', ['sqrt', 'log2'])
}
```

Optuna explored the space using its internal **TPE-based Bayesian optimization**, and:

✅ Found the best parameters in just **1 minute 13 seconds**.

## 📊 Comparison with Other Methods

### ↻ Grid Search

```python
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 500, 800, 1000],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7, 10, 15],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10, 15],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 5, 10],
    'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2']
}
```

* Performed **4,000 fits**
* Took **11 minutes**
* Found **same result** as Optuna, but much slower

---

### 🎲 Random Search

```python
param_dist = {
    'n_estimators': randint(100, 1000),
    'max_depth': randint(3, 15),
    'min_samples_split': randint(2, 20),
    'min_samples_leaf': randint(1, 10),
    'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2']
}
```

* Performed **500 fits**
* Faster than Grid Search
* Less precise, but often acceptable

## 🏑 Summary

| Method           | Time     | Fits     | Accuracy | Notes                      |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| **Optuna (TPE)** | \~1m 13s | \~50–100 | ✅ Best   | Efficient, adaptive, smart |
| Grid Search      | \~11m    | 4000     | ✅ Same   | Exhaustive, slow           |
| Random Search    | \~3–5m   | 500      | \~Same   | Faster, but less efficient |

## 🧠 Conclusion

Optuna with Bayesian optimization (TPE) provided a **faster and smarter** approach to hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing training time while achieving the same or better performance than traditional grid/random search methods.
